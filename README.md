ProCord Request

In order to run this bot, you have to remotely install npm and also create a config file with the following values: token, prefix, exclusion (Array) and owner ID.

This is a request handled over the Discord Server ProCord, which allows for the creation of bots, servers, websites, writing, graphics and much more via a request system. The bot in particular was created for SwagNoReason#7779 and should therefore only be used after consulting him first.
